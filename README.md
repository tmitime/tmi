# About TMI

TMI (tmaÉª) is a time tracker designed to help you stay on track during a consultancy.

If you used an Excel sheet in the past to track activities you know that at some
point tasks are insterted in batches and formulas were required to understand
at which progress of the project or consultancy you are just to find out that
you worked more hours than planned.

Time tracking should be simple and integrated in your workflow. 

ðŸš§ **TMI is a work in progress**. Please, try it out and report back using [Discussions](https://github.com/tmitime/tmi/discussions).


**Current features**

- Projects, a container for the tasks (or activities) you track
- Tasks define the activity and how many minutes or hours you worked on it 
- Check a project status using the summary views 
- One tag (`tmi:Task` or `tmi:Meeting`) for each task to not be overwhelmed on the categorization of each task
- Teams to group projects together, especially useful if you have more that one project with a client

**Considered features**

- Define a work hours schedule on a project basis, useful in case by contract you have defined slots ([discussion#6](https://github.com/tmitime/tmi/discussions/6))
- Scrum ready, include in the tags hierarchy scrum specific naming ([discussion#7](https://github.com/tmitime/tmi/discussions/7))
- Auto-tagging based on task description, you should not waste time applying tags to tasks ([discussion#8](https://github.com/tmitime/tmi/discussions/8))
- Timers shared across devices, start your timer on one device and continue on the other ([discussion#10](https://github.com/tmitime/tmi/discussions/10))
- Connection to Gitlab to synchronize projects and tasks ([discussion#11](https://github.com/tmitime/tmi/discussions/11))

And [many more](https://github.com/tmitime/tmi/discussions?discussions_q=label%3A%22Under+Consideration+%28idea%29%22).
